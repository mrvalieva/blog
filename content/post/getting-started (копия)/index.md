## Обзор

1. У мусульман сейчас священный месяц Рамадан. В это время они отказываются от еды от зари до заката. В этом году я вместе с друзьями решила держать пост.
2. На прошлой неделе я выполняла лабораторную работу №7 по операционным системам.В данной лабораторной работе я изучила много всего.
3. Также мы с братом поехали на воробьевы горы и три часа катались на самокатах!! (потом мой гайморит сказал мне привет, я возвращаюсь)
